  intro:
    'Thinking about a coding bootcamp? Already been accepted? Partway through and feeling overwhelmed? Whatever the case, here are a few thoughts on how to make the most of your time (and hopefully avoid going crazy).',
  suggestions: [
    {
      heading: 'Get some sleep',
      body: 'This is probably the most important suggestion I can make. You will be learning a lot. There will always be so much more to learn. Your cohort mates will be staying up late working, coding through every weekend, and you’ll feel like you should be doing the same thing. Please don’t. Your brain needs time to relax, to recharge. You need time to make neurological connections; to process lessons and concepts. Prioritize sleep; it will make you smarter, nicer, happier, and more fun to be around.'
    },
    {
      heading: 'Focus on you',
      body: 'A coding bootcamp is a lot like drinking water from a firehose. There is an insane amount that you don’t know; you don’t even know what you don’t know. It feels scary. There will be way too much information coming at you to fully process all of it (or even most of it). There will be classes you feel like you should attend because they are on some random subject that isn’t required and you’ve never heard of, but some of your cohort mates are going to it (maybe they even requested it). Additionally there are more articles, labs, and YouTube videos on development than anyone could read / do / watch (never mind actually understand) in a lifetime.<br/><br/>Take a step back, and think about what you want to learn. Focus first on what is required to pass each module, and second on what is of most interest to you. Don’t worry about what everyone else is doing.'
    },
    {
      heading: "Don't compare yourself to others",
      body: 'Odds are, you’re not going to be the best student in your cohort; don’t expect to be. Also, who cares? You enroll in a bootcamp to learn, and to better yourself. Everyone has different backgrounds, and learns at different rates. Some people come into bootcamps with a bunch of coding experience, others have some other technical background. If you think about it, the student who gets the best value from a bootcamp is the one who learns the most by the end, not the one who knows the most by the end - keep this in mind.<br/><br/>It’s easy to get discouraged when other people are understanding something more quickly than you are, but that really doesn’t mean you can’t handle it, that you won’t be a good software engineer, or anything else of the sort. It just means people are different.'
    },
    {
      heading: 'Code daily (at least during the week)',
      body: 'People have different approaches to working over the weekend, and that’s kind of a personal thing, so I won’t speak to that here except to say that I coded only one weekend day during my 15-week program and I did pretty well.<br/><br/>But either way, you need to code. A lot. You can’t just watch videos and attend class. When I was learning to surf, I watched some surfers while I sat on the beach and my instructor explained what to do. I was thinking ‘yeah I get it, looks pretty straightforward.’ A few minutes later I was out drifting around in the waves and struggling to sit on the board, never mind stand up on it. It felt completely different from being on the beach, and I couldn’t remember anything the instructor had said. But after roughly 1,165 face plants, I started to get the hang of it. Coding is no different. You learn to code by coding. You mess up, you get errors, you learn to fix them. If you want to learn to code: code. A lot.'
    },
    {
      heading: 'Ask questions',
      body: 'Google is your best friend (or will be) so become aquatinted. This is the best place to start when you have an error you don’t understand, or are trying to figure something out. Learn to Google well, it’s an invaluable skill (both for during bootcamp and for your life as a dev, or so I’m told).<br/><br/>In addition, ask your cohort mates. Other students will grasp concepts at different rates, so ask them for help when they seem to get something you don’t. And of course, ask your instructors! Request classes, 1:1’s, advice, etc. You are paying them to help you, so take full advantage.'
    },
    {
      heading: 'Manage your time',
      body: 'There are lots of time management techniques, and different ones work for different people. But learn a few, and find one (or several) that work for you. A coding bootcamp is a lot. It’s called a ‘bootcamp’ for a reason. It can be overwhelming, but can also be an incredible opportunity. Make the most of your experience by managing your time well.'
    },
    {
      heading: 'Make friends',
      body: 'A bootcamp is a wonderful opportunity to make new friends, and if you don’t do this, you are doing it wrong. Other students can help you with concepts you don’t understand. You can help them and in doing so solidify your own knowledge. You can make contacts that will benefit you over the course of your entire career as a developer. And finally (and perhaps most importantly), your fellow students will help keep you sane. They are the only ones who really get how you feel, and what you’re going through. Be kind, help each other out, and spread the love.'
