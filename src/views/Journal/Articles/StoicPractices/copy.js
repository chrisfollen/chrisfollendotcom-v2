    {
      heading: 'Read',
      body: 'Seneca wrote “No man was ever wise by chance”. Reading is a chance to communicate with some of the greatest thinkers that have ever lived. It’s probably the shortest path to self-improvement, too.<br/><br/>Expose yourself to new ideas, challenge your assumptions, and expand your knowledge base. We live in a time where most of us have access to nearly all of the knowledge that exists, all of the time, and almost for free. Take full advantage.<br/><br/>Lots of people throughout history have already solved the problems we struggle with today. They’ve already made the mistakes we continue to make. Learn from the past, rather than continuing to repeat it.'
    },
    {
      heading: 'Guard your time',
      body: 'Marcus Aurelius wrote “Stop whatever you’re doing for a moment and ask yourself: Am I afraid of death because I won’t be able to do this anymore?”. Certainly, a fear of death is natural, but are you afraid of death because you are so thoroughly enjoying life, or because you have yet to start living? We should all strive to live a life that encourages the former. <br/><br/>We each get an unknown and admittedly arbitrary amount of time in this life. Consider how you spend your time. What if rather than mindlessly scrolling social media or arguing with strangers or giving in to temporary impulses, we spent our time doing work we cared about - work that improved our lives and the lives of those around us. <br/><br/>Take time to consider what is most important to you. Think about the most important contributions you can make with your time here. And then say no to everything else.'
    },
    {
      heading: 'Strive to be virtuous',
      body: 'The Stoics focused on the four pillars of virtue: wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice. They believed that a virtuous life was the summon bonum - the highest good. <br/><br/>What if we all took the same approach? What if we each evaluated our lives, and actions, and decisions, based on this same metric. Rather than focusing on what might bring us more money or fame or short-term relief, we strived for something bigger. A virtuous life is certainly not easy, and I do not mean to suggest that it is. But it is undoubtedly more rewarding. <br/><br/>Emerson wrote “The essence of greatness is the perception that virtue is enough”. I for one will continue to pursue that kind of greatness.'
    },
    {
      heading: 'Steer clear of vanity',
      body: 'Remember what is important (virtue) and don’t spend time worrying about the stuff that isn’t. After a recommendation from Tim Ferriss I bought a pair of ridiculous tropical-style pants that I regularly wear around town in Colorado. Yes, they look outrageous; yes, people stare at me; and yes, I sometimes feel self conscious. But that’s the point - to train myself against superficial distractions and the opinions of strangers.'
    },
    {
      heading: 'Embrace discomfort',
      body: 'Putting yourself in situations where you are uncomfortable, both physically and emotionally, helps expand your comfort zone. It helps cultivate grit and determination, and builds your tolerance. <br/><br/>Take a cold shower; go outside without a jacket on; skip a meal; take some time off of drinking alcohol. Don’t spend any money for a day or two; learn a new skill; have a difficult conversation. <br/><br/>We can all benefit from exposure to challenging or uncomfortable situations, if not to prepare for the unknowns that lay ahead (“We do not rise to the level of our hopes, we fall to the level of our training”), then at least to cultivate some gratitude and appreciate things like hot water and food security.'
    },
    {
      heading: 'Consider your own mortality',
      body: 'I realize this is a difficult exercise, and that it can be incredibly depressing if you miss the point. But the Stoics find thinking about death to be both calming and invigorating. The principle of momento mori is described by Marcus Aurelius: “You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think.” <br/><br/>Nothing is certain except death. None of us know how long we have left in this life, except that it is a relatively small amount of time. All we have is the present - the future is not guaranteed and thus not really ours to lose. We have this day, this moment even; anything beyond that is a bonus. Given this reality, please don’t spend your time on non-essential tasks. Don’t let your gravestone read ‘She checked email’ or ‘He watched Netflix’. This life is an incredible gift. We don’t know where it comes from. We don’t know how long it will last. Live accordingly and take full advantage of your time. <br/><br/>At some point in the relatively near future, you will be gone from this life. And the world will have forgotten you. <br/><br/>Don’t be lazy; don’t procrastinate. Don’t conform. Don’t worry about what others are doing; don’t let them prioritize your life. Live your life on your terms. Live with virtue. In the end, that’s all that matters; that is a life well-lived.'
