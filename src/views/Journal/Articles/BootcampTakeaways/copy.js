      body: 'I was never a coder, or a tech guy. My dev experience until recently consisted of an intro to computer science class in college fifteen years ago. I have two degrees engineering, and I spent five years working as a structural engineer. I then quit my design engineering job and spent three years working as a freelance photographer before enrolling at Flatiron School.'

      heading: 'The bootcamp',
      body: 'After extensive research, and talking to graduates, I decided to enroll in Flatiron’s 15-week immersive software engineering program. Before the COVID pandemic, this was an in-person program in Denver, though it was run entirely online while I was a student. The program was broken up into five three-week modules: (1) Ruby, (2) Ruby on Rails, (3) Javascript, HTML, CSS, (4) React, (5) A capstone project.'

      heading: 'My experience',
      body: 'I went from having a very basic understanding of HTML to building full-stack applications in six weeks. I learned the basics of Ruby and Rails, Javascript, HTML & CSS, and React. I rebuilt my personal website (the one you’re reading this on) as my capstone project. I graduate tomorrow, and as I write this, I am both blown away by how much I learned, and feel very confident that I know basically nothing. I made some wonderful friends, and learned a lot about myself on this journey. And I accepted a full-time frontend development job with an awesome company last week.<br/><br/>Let me say first that you absolutely do not need to attend a bootcamp to learn to code, or to learn to code well. You also don’t need to have a certificate from a bootcamp in order to find a job (nor does a bootcamp guarantee you a job upon graduation), but it probably helps.<br/><br/>What my bootcamp did provide was a wonderful framework for learning. It provided excellent material, and access to some wonderful instructors. It also provided an encouraging and structured learning environment, full of motivated peers that were in a similar boat. There was consistent support from the instructors, and well-defined checkpoints on your progress as well as frequent feedback. It also provided access to career services.<br/><br/>I can say resolutely that I would not have learned anywhere near as much as I did by skipping the bootcamp and studying by myself for four months. I can’t speak to the career services aspect, as I didn’t really use it, but I do believe had I not been nearly done with a bootcamp, I would not have landed an interview (never mind an offer) with my new company.<br/><br/>The bootcamp definitely did not provide knowledge, but rather, it provided the opportunity to learn, and this is a critical distinction. It was a lot of work, and required a lot of time in order to make the most of the experience - like most things in life, you get out of it what you put into it.'

    {
      heading: 'The verdict',
      body: 'For me, I believe this bootcamp was the best possible way I could have spent the past four months. I learned a ton, made some wonderful friends, and landed a job in a brand new industry. While I’m of course excited to begin my new career, there is certainly a (large) part of me that is sad this chapter is coming to a close.<br/><br/>Attending this bootcamp did not, by itself, completely change the direction of my life. It still took a lot of work on my end, and there is still a lot more to do and to learn. It didn’t guarantee me knowledge, or a job, or anything like that. But it was surely a piece of the larger puzzle, and a pretty big piece at that.'
