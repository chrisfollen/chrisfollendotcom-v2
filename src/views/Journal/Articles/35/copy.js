    'Remember when you wanted what you have right now.',
    'Don’t waste a good day. If you’re feeling creative, create. If you’re feeling healthy and motivated, go surfing.  The errands can wait until tomorrow.',
    'Discipline equals freedom.',
    'Beyond a basic level of income, opt for more autonomy rather than more money.',
    'Let go of expectations. Disappointment takes adequate planning.',
    'Focus on systems, not goals.  We don’t rise to the level of our goals, we fall to the level of our systems.',
    'Whatever it is, you’re probably taking it too seriously.',
    'Acquiring experiences will generally bring much greater satisfaction than acquiring things will.',
    'Mood follows action, not the other way around.  Stop waiting for motivation to strike; just do the work.',
    'A lot of conflict and frustration stem from poor communication.  Be direct and honest with people.',
    'Take off the week between Christmas and New Years.',
    'You are more interested in your possessions than anyone else is.',
    'Define your values and hold them close. But understand the difference between values and opinions. Base your opinions on your values (not the other way around), and always be open to changing opinions based on new information.',
    'Avoid toxic people.',
    'Pick up trash when you see it.',
    'You could leave life right now. Let that influence what you do and say and think.',
    'Very few things are critically important.  There is an overwhelming amount of noise.  John Maxwell wrote “You cannot overestimate the unimportance of practically everything”.',
    'Don’t believe everything you think.',
    'Any success you have achieved is likely in spite of your self-criticism, not because of it.',
    'Decisions are made by those who show up.',
    'Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to be.',
    'The sum of your life literally is the sum of the things you pay attention to.  Choose carefully.',
    'Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.',
    'Punctuality is a sign of respect.',
    'Be quick to say ‘no’ and slow to say ‘yes’.  Remember that anytime you say ‘yes’, you are saying no to literally everything else for that block of time.  Bear in mind that you have a very limited time here and can’t possibly even say ‘yes’ to everything you’d like to say ‘yes’ to.',
    'Spend more time in nature.',
    'There are no solutions. There are only tradeoffs.',
    'Don’t pursue ‘quality time’.  It’s all quality time.',
    'You will miss out on almost every experience the world has to offer.  You cannot change this.  Instead, focus on fully enjoying and appreciating the minuscule slice of experiences you do get, whatever they are.',
    'Live below your means.',
    'If you do not prioritize your own life, someone else will prioritize it for you.',
    'I think the secret to a good life might be to live a good day today.',
    'Concern yourself less with where you are right now and more with the trajectory you are on.',
    'On your deathbed, you’d likely give anything for one more evening commute listening to music, one more chance to stand in the checkout line at Whole Foods, one more morning in the surf lineup when the waves are terrible, one more ordinary evening at home. Don’t pass up the opportunity to fully appreciate the present, and don’t take it for granted.',
    'Living virtuously is its own reward.'
