  title: 'Five Readable Books of Philosophy',
  date: 'August 8, 2019',
  intro:
    'We could all use a little more philosophy in our lives. Who we are, and what we believe, are of course intertwined. Here are five books on philosophy that are both thought-provoking and readable.',
  books: [
    {
      heading: 'Letters from a Stoic | Seneca',
      body: 'Powerful and practical, digestible and sagacious, this is book is always my first recommendation when asked about an introductory book on Stoicism. A collection of 124 letters written by Seneca on how to incorporate Stoicism in one’s life. In many ways ahead of his time (and ours), his ideas are at once simple and incredibly profound.<br/><br/>I think everyone should read this book, if for no other reason than to consider the fact that you already have “enough”.'
    },
    {
      heading: 'Meditations | Marcus Aurelius',
      body: 'The private thoughts of the most powerful man in the world, Meditations was the journal of Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. Throughout the book Marcus both offers himself advice and reminders, as well as struggles through difficulties and muses about different accepts of life.<br/><br/>He covers topics such from having control over one’s own mind, to dealing with evil; from getting out of bed in the morning, to the inevitability of death. Full of actionable advice, this text was surely used by Marcus throughout his life. We would do well to follow his example.<br/><br/>Put simply, Meditations has had a larger impact on my life than anything else I have ever read.'
    },
    {
      heading: 'Man’s Search for Meaning | Viktor Frankl',
      body: 'In September of 1942 in Vienna, a young psychiatrist named Viktor Frankl was arrested by the Nazis and thrown in a concentration camp, along with his parents, his brother, and his pregnant wife. All of them, except Frankl, died there. Despite his losses, and the hopelessness of his condition, Frankl found meaning in the suffering. To call this text ‘incredibly powerful’ would be a massive understatement.'

    {
      heading: 'Shop Class as Soulcraft | Matthew Crawford',
      body: 'What we once built, we now buy; what we once fixed, we now throw out and replace. And these choices largely make sense from a purely economical standpoint (though surely not from an environmental one), Crawford makes a compelling case that our detachment from material reality is in fact downgrading our quality of life.<br/><br/>After graduating with a PhD in Political Philosophy, Crawford staring working at a DC think-tank where certain facts were appreciated while others went ignored. He lasted six months before he quit and opened a motorcycle repair shop. He argues that not only was his work as a mechanic more satisfying, but it was also more intellectually demanding than much of the work he had done previously in ‘white-collar’ jobs.<br/><br/>This book is an eye-opening exploration of the satisfaction of working with one’s hands, and the ways in which it is tragically devalued in 21st century America.'
    },
    {
      heading: 'Walden | Henry David Thoreau',
      body: 'You’ve probably heard the story - Thoreau spent two years, two months, and two days living in a small and simple cabin he built himself on the shore of Walden Pond in Concord, Massachusetts. He did this in an attempt to ‘live deliberately’, that is, to think about what is really important and live accordingly - to live an examined life.<br/><br/>As relevant now as it was 160 years ago, this exploration of the simple life is one that we could all learn something from. Thoreau writes ‘Men have become the tools of their tools’. No kidding.'
